## 📖 Overview

Studio Ghibli animations are renowned for their warm color tones, fantasy landscapes, and emotional depth. This project leverages CycleGAN to bring that hand-drawn magic to real-world images — all without paired data or pre-trained models.

**Project Title:** *Ghibli Style Transfer using CycleGAN*  
**Team Name:** *Fusion Eyes*  
**Team Members:**
- 👤 Kanan Pandit (B2430051)

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🧾 Transform real-world photographs into Studio Ghibli-style images.
- ♻️ Use **CycleGAN** for unpaired image-to-image translation.
- 🧱 Preserve semantic structures (e.g., faces, scenes).
- 💻 Implement the model **from scratch** for deeper understanding.

## 🧠 Motivation

> Why Ghibli?

Studio Ghibli films evoke nostalgia, warmth, and fantasy. Their distinct visual style is challenging for AI to replicate — making them perfect for testing the limits of deep learning in aesthetic transformation.
